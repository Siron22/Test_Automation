Method 1: A decorator
Pros:
    Decorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.
Cons:
    While objects created using MyClass() would be true singleton objects, MyClass itself is a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it.

Method 4: decorator returning a class with the same name
Pros:
    It's a true class
    Auto-magically covers inheritance
Cons:
    Is there not an overhead for creating each new class? Here we are creating two classes for each class we wish to make a singleton. While this is fine in my case, I worry that this might not scale. Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...
    What is the point of the _sealed attribute
    Can't call methods of the same name on base classes using super() because they will recurse. This means you can't customize __new__ and can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to __init__.
